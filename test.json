This is a perfect printer for a small office, or home, and gives you the option to Scan/Print/Fax, and Wi-Fi connect.  You can find further technical information at dell.com http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/accessories/apd/210-afrw?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&sku=210-AFRW \n\nPrice is listed on the Dell site at $299, we actually paid a bit more, but selling at a reduced price since we don't need it. The printer comes with all unused color cartridges in place (see photo).\n\nAs you can see in the pictures, the packing tape is still in place and the plastic bag that covered the whole printer is also included, box no longer exists. Everything that came with this printer is included, Setup Guide, Installation Disk, Power Cable, and Phone/Fax Cable.  (See Photos).\n\nI travel between NoVA and Silver Spring, so arrangements to meet for pick up can be made anywhere convenient to both.\n\nPlease put Laser Printer in subject to avoid spam.

It was purchased in January of this year and has warranty until December 2019. This was purchased new and is still in the same condition as when it was purchased. It includes the laptop and charger. I am selling because the laptop does not get any use. This laptop is a great machine with a balance of power and battery life for when you're away from a socket. It can be used with a desktop graphics card if you'd like to use a more powerful card, via the Thunderbolt 3 port. The laptop gets amazing battery, it will last over 9 hours with brightness on full and Wi-Fi on. I can throw in some software if you'd like. Just let me know what you would like.
